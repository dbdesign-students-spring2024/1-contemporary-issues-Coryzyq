## Italy’s privacy watchdog warns OpenAI that ChatGPT breaches Europe’s privacy laws
In euronews's [Italy’s privacy watchdog warns OpenAI that ChatGPT breaches Europe’s privacy laws] (https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/01/29/italys-privacy-watchdog-warns-openai-that-chatgpt-breaches-europes-privacy-laws) The Italian privacy watchdog's investigation into OpenAI's ChatGPT reported a critical challenge with aligning AI technology with strict EU data protection laws. The probe highlights potential breaches, including a data leak and insufficient measures to protect minors.

This scrutiny has resulted in a temporary ban of ChatGPT in Italy, emphasizing the urgency for AI companies to adhere to international data privacy standards. The outcome of this case, as the European Data Protection Board announced, will set the beginning for the integration of AI technology with data protection regulations.

## ChatGPT can resume in Italy if meets data watchdog's demands
In Reuters' [ChatGPT can resume in Italy if meets data watchdog's demands] (https://www.reuters.com/technology/italy-lift-curbs-chatgpt-if-openai-meets-demands-by-end-april-data-protection-2023-04-12/) Garante, Italy's data protection agency, has set some demands to ChatGPT with a deadline of April 30 to comply. These demands, include informing Italian users about data processing methods, providing tools for data correction or deletion, and implementing an age verification system to restrict access for users under 13.

The Italian approach has sparked interest across Europe, with other privacy watchdogs contemplating similar demands. Spain's data protection agency has even called for an EU-wide evaluation of ChatGPT's privacy implications. These developments indicate a shift towards more stringent AI regulation, acknowledging the need for new frameworks to govern rapidly evolving AI technologies and their societal implications.
